# Dependencies
 - **Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3** for having access to the VBA Object Model
 - Unit Test Framework is **[AccUnit](https://accunit.access-codelib.net/)** v0.9.10 
 - **Microsoft HTML Object Library** to have easy access to the requested HTML Documents
 - **Microsoft XML, v3.0** to do XML HTTP Requests
 - Used Microsoft Office Excel version was v14.0.7268.5000(32bit) (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010)

# Deploy
If you want to release the file for production usage, you have to remove the accUnit testcode and its references first.
The accunit add-in has a nice auto-remove feature. By clicking on **"Extras/AccUnit-de/Testumgebung entfernen"** inside 
the VBA-IDE, all test releated stuff gets removed. Be sure
to do so. Otherwise there will be reference errors on the customers PC because of missing accunit libraries.
